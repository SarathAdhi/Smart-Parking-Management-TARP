# Smart Parking Management System
Technical Answers for Real World Problems (TARP) project for 6rd semester.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT:

What is smart parking?

The goal is to efficiently determine parking space through an interconnected system with smartphones and other sensors. This real time feedback is accomplished using counters and sensors embedded in the parking area.

# Challenges faced

1. Time :
Time taken to search for a parking space can be utilized elsewhere efficiently, especially in deployment areas such as hospitals etc. This holds true during exit aswell.

2. Inappropriate and unorganized parking:
In the current system drivers roam about the lot searching for any free space this leads to unnecessary banter and commotion, moreover the disorganization often cause delay in exit due to parking traffic.

3. Environmental factors:
Beside time, a lot of fuel is consumed looking for a parking space.

4. Clogging roads:
The insufficient utilization of the parking space and the current system proves to be frustration which causes drivers to park their vehicles on the road thus clogging them.

# Modules

The Real Time Smart Parking System Management will be a comprehensive system that will allow users to easily find and manage parking spots in real time. It will feature a variety of modules and components that will make the system more efficient and user friendly. The main modules of this system will include: 
1. Parking Spot Finder: This module will allow users to quickly find available parking spots based on their current location, or a specific address or area. It will also provide an option to reserve a parking spot for a specific duration. 

2. Payment Portal: This module will provide users with a secure payment option that can be used to pay for parking fees. This module will also be integrated with other payment gateways, such as PayPal, Apple Pay and Google Pay. 

3. Parking Spot Management: This module will provide users with the ability to manage their parking spots, including the ability to add, edit, or delete parking spots. It will also provide users with the ability to check availability, as well as to set specific rules and regulations for the parking spots. 

4. Reporting & Analytics: This module will provide users with the ability to generate reports and analyze data related to the usage of the system. This will be useful for tracking the performance of the system, as well as for identifying areas that need improvement. 6. Security: This module will be responsible for keeping the system secure, including the ability to detect and block any suspicious activities. It will also provide users with the ability to set specific security rules and regulations.
