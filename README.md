# Smart Parking Management System
Technical Answers for Real World Problems (TARP) project for 6rd semester.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT:

What is smart parking?

The goal is to efficiently determine parking space through an interconnected system with smartphones and other sensors. This real time feedback is accomplished using counters and sensors embedded in the parking area.

# Challenges faced

1. Time :
Time taken to search for a parking space can be utilized elsewhere efficiently, especially in deployment areas such as hospitals etc. This holds true during exit aswell.

2. Inappropriate and unorganized parking:
In the current system drivers roam about the lot searching for any free space this leads to unnecessary banter and commotion, moreover the disorganization often cause delay in exit due to parking traffic.

3. Environmental factors:
Beside time, a lot of fuel is consumed looking for a parking space.

4. Clogging roads:
The insufficient utilization of the parking space and the current system proves to be frustration which causes drivers to park their vehicles on the road thus clogging them.
